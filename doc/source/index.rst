RLFight-Engine documentation
============================

.. attention::
   This project is still very much a work in progress. Most functionality is either missing or in early stages of development.

A configurable game engine for fighting games. Initially this will only support 2D fighting games, but there is potential in future to open up 3D fighting game support. 

The engine was designed to facilitate the training of AI agents through reinforcement learning techniques. It is a hobby project largely inspired by the `FightingICE project <https://github.com/TeamFightingICE/FightingICE>`_, which I worked with during my university degree. The engine was designed with the following in mind:

* **Separation of game engine logic from rendering logic**
* **Determinism**
* **Online play with rollback netcode**
* **Fast simulation**
