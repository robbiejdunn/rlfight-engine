Choice of rendering engine
==========================

Since we want to see gameplay visualised as well as being simulated, we need to decide on which rendering engine to use. The features we require are:

* Supports 3D.
* Allows separation of rendering and game logic (headless?). Ability to run the game without drawing to the screen.
* Preferably supports many game engine languages, or the languages it supports are performant.

Options
-------

Unity
^^^^^

Unreal engine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Godot engine
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Custom engine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most flexible option, would need to assess what we need from a rendering engine (see section below).
